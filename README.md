#To run:

#NOTES:

 - The Search Feature its not created yet, but its ready to be implemented.
 - I have all prepared to work with a Pagination feature, but its not implemented. for implmement it I need or a service allowing filters parameters, or create a filter method from the mails stored in the store.
 either way I have to add the action for retreiving the mails filtered and then pass this new content to Mail Component
 - I use material-ui for improve the responsive performance
